# Safir.Alborz (Demo Version) – Clean Architecture & Multi-Tenant Platform 🌐

This repository contains a **training/demo version** of an enterprise-level, multi-tenant architecture built using **ASP.NET Core** and **Clean Architecture** principles.  
It is designed to **demonstrate structure, modularity, and scalability**, and can be **extended for real-world use** with appropriate security and production adjustments.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

> This is a practice project to showcase architectural patterns such as:
> - Clean Architecture
> - CQRS with MediatR
> - Multi-Tenancy (Database-per-tenant model)
> - Separation of Concerns

The codebase can serve as a solid foundation for developers or companies aiming to build enterprise systems — but it is **not production-ready** and **not secure for live deployments** in its current form.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- ASP.NET Core (.NET 9)
- Clean Architecture (Domain, Application, Infrastructure, API)
- CQRS using MediatR
- Entity Framework Core + SQL Server
- Identity + JWT + Claims
- Docker (planned)
- Swagger, FluentValidation, AutoMapper

---

## 📦 Main Modules (Work in Progress)

- `AuthService`: Centralized authentication and user-role management
- `HRService`: HR module (recruitment, leaves, attendance)
- `CMS`: Per-tenant customization and content
- `SalesService`: (Planned)
- `Tenant Management`: Database-per-tenant strategy

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is **not production-ready**.  
It is intended for **learning**, **experimentation**, and **architectural exploration**.  
Before using in a real environment, it requires:

- Security hardening (auth, data protection)
- Test coverage (unit & integration tests)
- Input validation improvements
- Proper deployment setup (Docker, CI/CD, secrets management)

---

## 📈 Future Improvements

- Docker Compose setup for local dev
- Multi-tenant database provisioning automation
- Full test suite
- Microservice communication via gRPC or Event Bus
- Real-world deployment configuration
